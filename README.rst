==================================
Joel's Foreign Currency Collection
==================================

A set of scripts for tracking my foreign currency collection.
Most of the countries that I have currency for are not yet tracked digitally with these scripts.

Notes by Country
----------------

Japan
'''''
While the sen was historically one hundredth of a yen, and the rin was one thousandth of a yen, they were both removed from circulation in 1953.
The 5 sen coin that I have was only minted in 1941-1942.

Hong Kong
'''''''''
All coins with denominations less than 10 cents have been taken out of circulation, even though they were minted for circulation as late as 1979.

Philippines
'''''''''''
From 1942-1945, Japan occupied the Philippines and distributed fiat banknotes.
I have some, but these were considered illegal tender immediately following WWII.

China
'''''
I have one outdated bill, from the first series of the renminbi.
It's a 2 fen bill that I wrote down as 1955, although this date is approximate.
The second series was completely recalled in 2007.

I have some coins that are actually from the second series of the renminbi, but they're still legal tender.
These are the 2 and 5 fen coins.

Costa Rica
''''''''''
I couldn't find it explicitly stated anywhere, but I'm pretty sure that the 50 centimos coin that I have is obsolete.

Indonesia
'''''''''
All denominations of less than 50 rupiah have been rendered obsolete by inflation.

Colombia
''''''''
Because of the current valuation of around 1900 Colombian pesos to 1 USD, the Colombian senate has debated redenomating the currency by introducing a new peso worth 1000 old pesos.
This hasn't happened yet, but my coins may soon be obsolete.
In 1984, production of all coins below 1 peso ended as a result of inflation.

East Africa Protectorate
''''''''''''''''''''''''
This country was created during British colonialism and no longer exists.
In 1920, it became the British colony of Kenya, and in 1963, it became the independent country of Kenya.
The coins apparently bore the name "East Africa" even after the region became the British colony of Kenya.
It occupied approximately the same area as modern-day Kenya.

I wasn't able to find actual information about the currency subdivisions of British Kenya, but modern Kenya uses a shilling that breaks down into 100 cents, so I'm reusing that.

Afghanistan
'''''''''''
In 2002, a new Afghani was issued following unrestricted printing under Taliban rule and the subsequent US invasion.
The new Afghanis have no subdivisions and replaced the old ones at two distinct rates (see below).
I don't know when mine was printed (I should make friends with someone who reads Farsi).

* Afghanis printed under President Burhanuddin Rabbani before the Taliban captured Kabul were valued at 1000:1

* Afghanis printed by the Northern Alliance (the government in exile during Taliban rule) were valued at 2000:1

Australia
'''''''''
The $5 bill that I have does not have a year printed on it.
I wrote it down as 1995 because that was the year that they started printing that series of note (and it is still in print).

Brazil
''''''
The 2 reais bill that I have does not have a year printed on it.
I wrote it down as 2000 because that was the first year that they printed 2 reais notes.
