==================================
Joel's Foreign Currency Collection
==================================

A set of scripts for tracking my foreign currency collection.
Most of the countries that I have currency for are not yet tracked digitally with these scripts.

Notes by Country
----------------

Japan
'''''
While the sen was historically one hundredth of a yen, and the rin was one thousandth of a yen, they were both removed from circulation in 1953.
The 5 sen coin that I have was only minted in 1941-1942.

Hong Kong
'''''''''
All coins with denominations less than 10 cents have been taken out of circulation, even though they were minted for circulation as late as 1979.

Philippines
'''''''''''
From 1942-1945, Japan occupied the Philippines and distributed fiat banknotes.
I have some, but these were considered illegal tender immediately following WWII.

China
'''''
I have one outdated bill, from the first series of the renminbi.
It's a 2 fen bill that I wrote down as 1955, although this date is approximate.
The second series was completely recalled in 2007.

I have some coins that are actually from the second series of the renminbi, but they're still legal tender.
These are the 2 and 5 fen coins.

Costa Rica
''''''''''
I couldn't find it explicitly stated anywhere, but I'm pretty sure that the 50 centimos coin that I have is obsolete.

Indonesia
'''''''''
All denominations of less than 50 rupiah have been rendered obsolete by inflation.
